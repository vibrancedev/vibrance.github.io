            <p>Joel Kim is a dedicated pastor and a graduate of Rutgers College (2005) and Princeton Theological
                Seminary (2009), where he earned his Masters of Divinity.</p><br> 
            <p> He honed his skills at the International House
                of Prayer in Kansas City and the Bethel School of Worship in Redding, California.
                With 17 years of full-time ministry experience, he's served as a youth pastor, worship pastor, and media
                pastor and is a creative at heart.</p><br>
            <p>
                Joel is happily married to his wonderful wife, Jane, and they dote on their cherished canine companion,
                Brie, whom they consider a part of the family.</p><br>
            <p>
                An enthusiastic sports enthusiast, Joel passionately supports the Brooklyn Nets and the NY Football
                Giants, along with being a devoted fan of the Korean National Team and its football players.</p><br>
            <p>
                His heart beats to witness people thrive and find freedom through the boundless love and grace of our
                Lord Jesus Christ in the Gospel. Joel is equally zealous about empowering creatives to unleash their
                full potential, igniting the world with their talents for the Gospel's sake.</p>
