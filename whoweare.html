            Our Core Values
        </h1>
    </section>

    <section class="row">
        <div class="longColumn">
            <h2>Christ</h2>
            <p>At Vibrance we are Christ-centered in all we do. The Gospel is central to our worship, preaching, and ministries. We believe that life transformation comes through the response and regeneration of our hearts and the conviction of sin through the preaching of Christ crucified.</p>
        <br>
            <h2>Community</h2>
            <p>At Vibrance we cherish the intimacy and inclusion of a close-knit community. While we acknowledge that we all will have our inner circles and cliques, we aim for everyone to be seen, heard, and embraced in the public setting. Furthermore, we believe in the life transformational intimacy that can be found within our Vibe groups and life transformation groups.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Celebration</h2>
            <p>At Vibrance we are huge on celebration! Under the umbrella of the Gospel, we celebrate everyone’s gifts, stories, journeys, and visions for life. We believe in a culture of celebration and gratitude that focuses on the goodness and grace of God in the gospel, and in the small and big ways He moves in our lives for our good.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Creativity</h2>
            <p>At Vibrance we believe heavily that the Church should be a place where creativity flourishes, rather than dies. We believe that creativity and excellence are not mutually exclusive but that both lead to the other. We cannot be creative without being excellent and we cannot be excellent without being creative. We believe in sharing the greatest message on earth through creativity to capture the hearts and inspire this generation, whether believer and especially unbeliever.</p>

            OUR CODE 
        </h1>
    </section>

    <section class="row">
        <div class="longColumn">
            <h2>1. Be Extravagant in Worship</h2>
            <p>Just like the woman who broke the alabaster jar over Jesus, we believe worship should be “wastefully” extravagant. Thus we host an environment where people pour out their hearts to God in song, prayer, and expressions of praise. We also believe that financial giving (2 Sam 24:24) is a beautiful aspect of worship. When we give, we give generously because we know we can never out give God.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>2. We Burn for Jesus</h2>
            <p>The early church was propelled forward not with apathy but with the fire of the Holy Spirit. We believe passionless Christianity is an oxymoron. If we carry the Holy Spirit inside of us, the last thing that should describe us is ordinary, passionless people. However, passion always seems to be the exception rather than the commonality. We believe at Vibrance that just as in the days of the early Church, fire and passion should be the defining trademark of God’s people.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>3. We were Called to be Free</h2>
            <p>Jesus came not only to save our lives, but also to restore us, bringing freedom and victory to our addictions, bondages and strongholds. We believe it is for freedom that Christ died on the Cross (Gal 5:1) and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom (2 Cor 3:17). Thus our ministries of healing and deliverance, discipleship, and accountability are all geared to get people free and keep them free. We also believe that Christ died to provide freedom to all who are made in God’s image. Thus we also pursue justice causes such as ending human trafficking and poverty to see everyone breathe freedom.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>4. Be Extraordinary in the Ordinary</h2>
            <p>Although our culture is infatuated with doing great things, we believe there is nothing more radical than extraordinary commitments to the ordinary, from our devotion to prayer and the Word, down to our basic ministry responsibilities. Faithfulness with small things prepares us to be entrusted with greater things.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>5. We Don't Maintain, We Multiply</h2>
            <p>Any movement of God should demonstrate momentum and bear fruit. We will not settle for maintaining an existence, but multiplying ourselves in growth both spiritually and in numbers. We believe the Gospel is the best message on earth and want it to go viral in our families, workplaces, and cities becoming disciples ourselves and making disciples out of others.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>6. Pay the Cost for Greater Rewards</h2>
            <p>We believe that great things don't come without a cost. Therefore, we choose to joyfully pay the cost and embrace suffering for the glory of Christ, realizing that in hindsight the costs are small in comparison to the rewards, blessings, and breakthroughs that are reaped later.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>7. God is Honored by a House of Honor</h2>
            <p>God is honored through a house of honor. The Kingdom advances through relationships as we relate as a family, yet function like an army. In these relationships, we believe in a culture of honor where we honor one another and honor the spiritual authorities God has set to lead us.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>8. Supernatural is Natural</h2>
            <p>Supernatural is natural to God. As His people, miracles, healings, signs and wonders should be natural to us as well. We choose to align our grid of understanding His ways not to our own experiences but the standards of God’s Word. Also, on a related note, we believe in laying down good structure (plans, programs, schedules) but we believe that structure should always submit to Spirit. Since the Holy Spirit is a lot like the wind and we can’t always predict what He’s going to do, we believe that flexibility and adaptability are key aspects of Christian faith.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>9. We are Contributors, not Consumers</h2>
            <p>The days of pastors and a select group of leaders doing the ministry while most of the congregation just watch are over! Scripture says we’re all called to be spiritual stones being built into a spiritual house, and that we’re all a holy priesthood offering our spiritual sacrifices of worship, service and the giftings He has placed in us.</p>
